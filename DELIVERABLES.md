**📝 Brief Note:**  
The layout was built using a reusable `ProductCard` component that receives props already adapted to the required format (name, image, price, variants, stock). This component uses Bootstrap to achieve a clean and modern UI, with clear visual hierarchy between the image, title, price, and actions.  
The design is fully responsive using Bootstrap’s grid system (`col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3`), allowing the product cards to automatically adjust from 1 to 4 columns depending on the screen width, ensuring readability and easy interaction across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
